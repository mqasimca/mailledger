# No Commit Rule

**NEVER create git commits** in this project unless explicitly requested by the user with clear, unambiguous language like "commit this" or "create a commit".

- Do not commit after completing tasks
- Do not commit when fixing bugs
- Do not commit when adding features
- Do not suggest committing changes

The user will handle all git commits manually.
